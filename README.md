# NetSoft2020-Tutorial4-Demo2-Exp1

## Expected result
After installation, nine containers are available, two of then running User Equipment (UE) and Evolved Node B (eNB) and the others running the elements of 5ht Generation Core Network. As illustrated in the figure below, UE can establish an internet connection, provided through combining functionality of all components. This environment is useful for studies relatated to RAN combined with the 5ht Generation Core Network.

## Installation

**Requirements**

The installation can be done directly over the host operating system (OS) or inside a virtual machine (VM). System requirements:
* CPU type: x86-64 (specific model and number of cores only affect performance)
* RAM: 4 GB
* Disk space: 40 GB
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

**Steps**

Install python-minimal:
```
sudo apt update && apt install python-minimal -y
```

Install git:
```
sudo apt -y install git
```

Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/LABORA-INF-UFG/NetSoft2020-Tutorial4-Demo2-Exp1.git
```

Install Ansible:
```
sudo apt -y install ansible
```

Run ```ifconfig``` and get the name of **internet network interface**, like as illustrated in the figure below:
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/if_config.PNG"/> 
</p>

Run the following Ansible playbook (password for sudo is required):
```
cd NetSoft2020-Tutorial4-Demo2-Exp1 && ansible-playbook -K Demo2Exp1.yml  -e  "internet_network_interface=<< internet network interface name>>"
```

Check if the containers are up:
```
sudo docker ps
```
The output should be similar to the following:
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/docker_state_running.png"/> 
</p>

Done! The software is successfully installed.

## Tests

In order to make the tests, access the User Equipment container: 
``` 
 docker exec -ti ue bash 
```
 
 List the network interfaces:
```
ifconfig
```

The output should be similar to the following:
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ue_network_interfce.png"/> 
</p>

Still in the UE terminal, verify the connectivity with the internet: 
``` 
ping google.com -I <<ip-address-user-equipment-interface>> 
```

The output should be similar to the following:
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ping_result.png"/>

## Additional comments
### Free5GC Web Application
[Free5GC](https://www.free5gc.org/) provide a web application to register and management of the UE's. You can access the application your web browser by the address ```http://<deployment-environment-IP-address>:3000```, a login page will appear like as the next image.
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/web_ui_login.png"/> 
</p>

The Web Application access port can be changed through the parameter ```web_application_access_port```, the default value is _3000_. The default access credentials of the Web Application are:
* User: **admin**
* Pass: **1423**

After accessing Web Application, you can check in main page the existence of UEs registered,  the result should be equivalent to that shown in the next figure:
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/web_ui_dashboard.png"/> 
</p>

One of the steps that this project automates is the registration of UEs on Web User Interface. By default, _ansible playbook_ adds 3 Ue's.

### Free5GC Log's
You can check the life cycle of each [Free5GC](https://www.free5gc.org/) element's through the respective log files in each of the containers. 
UPF log file:
```
docker exec -it upf bash
cat /root/free5gc-stage-1/install/var/log/free5gc/free5gc.log
```
PCRF log file:
```
docker exec -it pcrf bash
cat /root/free5gc-stage-1/install/var/log/free5gc/free5gc.log
```
SMF log file:
```
docker exec -it smf bash
cat /root/free5gc-stage-1/install/var/log/free5gc/free5gc.log
```
AMF life cicle:
```
docker exec -it amf bash
cat /root/free5gc-stage-1/install/var/log/free5gc/free5gc.log
```
The output of AMF log file should be similar to the following:
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/amf_life_cicle_log.png"/> 
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/amf_life_cicle_log_2.png"/> 
</p>

### OpenAirInterface Log's
You can check the life cycle of each [OpenAirInterface System Emulation](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g/wikis/OpenAirLTEEmulation) element's through the respective log files in each of the containers. 
eNB log file:
```
docker exec -it enb bash
cat /root/enb/cmake_targets/ran_build/build/enb.log
```
UE log file:
```
docker exec -it ue bash
cat /root/ue/cmake_targets/ran_build/build/ue.log
```

### Configuration Files
The entire integration process between [OpenAirInterface System Emulation](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g/wikis/OpenAirLTEEmulation) and [Free5GC](https://www.free5gc.org/) is carried out through configuration files. Into eNB container, the connection between **eNB / AMF** and **eNB / UE** is done through the file ``` rcc.band7.tm1.nfapi.conf ```.

To access ``` rcc.band7.tm1.nfapi.conf ``` file content run this:
```
docker exec -it enb bash
cat enb/ci-scripts/conf_files/rcc.band7.tm1.nfapi.conf
```
Inside the file you should be find something similar to the following:
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/rcc_band7_tm1_nfapi.png"/> 
</p>

Into UE container, the connection between **UE** and **eNB** is done through the file ``` ue.nfapi.conf ```.
To access ``` ue.nfapi.conf ``` file content run this:
```
docker exec -it ue bash
cat ue/ci-scripts/conf_files/ue.nfapi.conf
```
Inside the file you should be find something similar to the following:
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ue_nfapi.png"/> 
</p>

All [Free5GC](https://www.free5gc.org/) containers contains a configuration file ``` free5gc.conf ```. This file contains a configuration parameters between all the 5GC elements (AMF, SMF, UPF, PCRF, HSS).
To access ``` free5gc.conf ``` file content into AMF container run this:
```
docker exec -it amf bash
cat free5gc-stage-1/install/etc/free5gc/free5gc.conf
```
 The output should be similar to the following:
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/free5gc_conf_1.png"/> 
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/free5gc_conf_2.png"/> 
</p>

All the configuration files is built by automated way with ansible. You can access the default values inside the playbook file ``` Demo2Exp1.yml ``` in section **vars**.
